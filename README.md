# Weather Station

A weather station equipped with a BME 280, a voltage sensor and any additional I2C device for monitoring temperature, humidity and air pressure in a room or outside.
It is designed to work with a ESP-01 in deep sleep, but any other ESP may work.
On 6 AA batteries it may run for half a year or longer.
